## Here, the main aim of the program is to extract the answers from the questions.

## We have only one prerequisite for this program which is the Stopwords.txt file.

### The steps to extract the answers are as follows:

1. Import the wordnet

2. Prepocess the text by splitiing it into individual sentences, converting to lower case, remving extra spaces and special symbols.

3. Check for parts of speech for the remaining words

4. Remove stopwords from the list

5. After this, we will remove the synonyms of each word and compare the similarity of filtered words with each other
